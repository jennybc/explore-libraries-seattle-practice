## Workshop challenge checklist

*As you complete tasks, you can ~~cross them out~~ by surrounding with
`~~`.*

  - Have a look around the files here. Where are the R scripts? What are
    the directories `data` and `figs` for?
  - Notice that this README is an `.Rmd` file. That means it could
    contain R code and will need to be rendered to create `README.md`.
  - Open
    [R/01\_write-installed-packages.R](R/01_write-installed-packages.R).
    Write the script as directed. Run it. Commit and push the current
    state.
  - Open [R/02\_wrangle-packages.R](R/02_wrangle-packages.R). Fill in
    the missing pieces of the script as directed. Run it. Commit and
    push the current state.
  - Open
    [R/03\_barchart-packages-built.R](R/03_barchart-packages-built.R).
    Fill in the missing pieces of the script as directed. Run it. Commit
    and push the current state.
  - Fill in the blanks below in this README, using the results stored
    elsewhere.
  - If you get this far, write an R script to run the whole analysis
    and, perhaps, another script that does a `make clean` style reset.

## Overview

The goal of packages-report is to FINISH THIS SENTENCE.

I have `FILL THIS IN!!!` add-on packages installed.

Hereâ€™s how they break down in terms of which version of R they were
built under, which is related to how recently they were updated on CRAN.

### Flow of the analysis

*If you have time, document the analysis works, using internal links.*
