## Overview

The goal of packages-report is to explore the packages in my R installation.

```{r, include = FALSE}
freqtable_file <- fs::dir_ls(here::here("data"), glob = "*freqtable.csv")
apt_freqtable <- readr::read_csv(freqtable_file)
```

I have `r sum(apt_freqtable$n)` add-on packages installed.

Here's how they break down in terms of which version of R they were built under, which is related to how recently they were updated on CRAN.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
apt_freqtable %>% 
  mutate(prop = round(prop, 2)) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```
